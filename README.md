# 📝 Keeper Note (Frontend)

Keeper Note is a simple and clean note-taking app built with React. This project is part of my ongoing journey to improve my frontend and full-stack development skills.

🔧 This repository contains only the frontend code. The backend is available [here](https://github.com/thanaphon0737/Keeper_backend).

🚀 What I’m Learning
This project is helping me strengthen my skills in:

🧠 React (functional components, hooks, props/state)

🎨 Responsive UI design with CSS

📦 Component architecture & reusability

🌐 Connecting frontend to a backend API

🧪 Debugging and working with developer tools
